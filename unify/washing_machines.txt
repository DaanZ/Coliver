You can use the washing machines located outside on the laundry side to wash and dry your clothes. The lines are also at your disposal to dry your clothes. If you see that the lines are already occupied by laundry please put it in a basket so that the next person can pick them up and you can hang out your wet clothes.
If you wash your clothes in the washing machines please use your own detergent and your own products please.
