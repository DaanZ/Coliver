The Colivers are talking about us
Amelie et Nejma2 friends on vacation in Réunion
“A really top-notch room, a rather quiet neighborhood, and very friendly hosts; in short, we had a great relaxing weekend. The SPA is incredible; steam room, sauna, jacuzzi, and a swimming pool, there’s really plenty to enjoy! This little weekend truly makes you want to go back; I recommend without any hesitation.”
30-year-old couple, residing in MayotteSauna enthusiast (of Finnish origin), visiting on vacation
“Spent an excellent week at this villa. The photos match the listing, the suite is comfortable (with soft, good-quality bedding) and the communal living spaces are spacious and stylish. The suite and its small adjoining terrace allow for privacy. However, the Colivers are so welcoming and open-minded that we felt ‘right at home’ and preferred the shared veranda in their company. We will be back!! Highly recommended accommodation in the winter season for sauna enthusiasts 🙂”
GregorSolitary traveler arrived from Estonia for an introspective trip to Réunion.
“A villa where you feel good. The colivers are welcoming and warm while giving you space. I recommend it if you want to have a good time after a long day of hiking/visiting. The on-site spa is very much appreciated. First successful coliving experience.”
BenoitVisiting for the 3rd time on the island, a fan of Coliving.
“Great stay in this coliving with beautiful prospects. The location is ideal for visiting many points of interest on the island, including the volcano and the Cirque de Cilaos. The facilities in the villa really add to the enjoyment of the stay (pool, sauna, jacuzzi, etc.) The welcome from the colivers makes you quickly feel comfortable within the coliving, and the moments of sharing are memorable. Thank you 🙏”

“A villa where you feel comfortable. The colivers are welcoming and warm while also giving you space. I recommend it if you want to have a good time after a long day of hiking/sightseeing. The on-site spa is greatly appreciated. A successful first coliving experience.”
Shalini et StephaneArrived from Guadeloupe to settle in Réunion 
“Wonderful place that I highly recommend. The possibility of a spa after a hike is a significant bonus. The hosts are charming and dedicated, friendly and dynamic, hardworking but always up for a party. There are good vibes all around, it’s a great place to live with the jasmine scenting the air, especially in the evening. Keep your vibe going and continue on your path, you will do wonders!! Best wishes and thank you for everything!! Shalini”
