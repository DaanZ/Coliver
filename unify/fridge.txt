You can store your groceries in the two fridges in the kitchen. The bins assigned to you are marked with labels with the name of your accommodation. You can also store your groceries in the fridge doors, please read the labels carefully to see if the items in them belong to someone or if they are shared.

You can also use the cupboards to the right of the fridges in the kitchen to store your food. You will find labels with the name of your accommodation on the drawers or shelves
